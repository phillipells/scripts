make repository on github website
clone the repo made on github so git clone git@github.com:phillipells/reponame
NO NEED FOR THIS IF CLONED >> git init inside directory actually maybe not if it's cloned
throw shit in there
git add .   to add stuff recursively
git commit -m "message"
git pull git@github.com:phillipells/reponame.git > probably isn't necessary
git push -u origin master

YAY I FINALLY GOT IT ALL GOING!!

for adding stuff

just throw the files in there
then git add filename
git commit -m "bal"
git push -u origin master
